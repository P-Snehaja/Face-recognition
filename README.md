## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook implements a Facial Emotion Recognition system using the ResNet-50 deep learning model. The model is trained to classify facial expressions into different emotion categories based on image data. It leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract deep features from facial images and make accurate emotion predictions.
